                                Technology has facinated me from a very early age. This lead me to 
                                        tinker with old computers, software, and other things. Which ultimatly
                                        led me to HTML. The power to create web pages facanated me and my
                                        passion for development grew.

                                After many years of self teaching and online tutorials I learned the 
                                        basics of object oriented programming. The logical aspect of creating
                                        software to solve problems was something I became passionate about.
                                        This lead me to seek a degree in the field. The rapid pace of change
                                        that coinsides with this field asured me there is always something new
                                        to learn.
